#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Given the current date and birth date held by the variables
#above, calculate and print this person's current age. Note
#that if their birth date has not yet passed this year, your
#result would be one less than if it has.
#
#For example, with the variables given above, the person
#would turn 28 on December 12th, 2018. So, as of May 31st,
#2018, they are 27.
